```tact

```
Exit code: **44401**

Checks the condition and throws an error with an exit code generated from the error message if the condition is false. Does nothing otherwise.

 The generated exit code is guaranteed to be outside the common 0âˆ’255 range reserved for TVM and Tact contract errors, which makes it possible to distinguish exit codes from `require()` and any other standard exit codes.


```tact
fun examples() {
    // now() has to return a value greater than 1000,
    // otherwise an error message will be thrown
    require(now() > 1000, "We're in the first 1000 seconds of 1 January 1970!");

    try {
        // The following will never be true, so this require would always throw
        require(now() < -1, "Time is an illusion. Lunchtime doubly so.");
    } catch (e) {
        // e will be outside of range 0-255
        dump(e);
    }
}
```
