## Quick start

The easiest way to get started with Tact is to use VS Code or editors based on it:

1. Install the [Tact language extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=tonstudio.vscode-tact) for
   VS Code.
2. That's it!

## Installation

### VS Code / VSCodium / Cursor / Windsurf

Download and install the extension:

1. Get the latest `.vsix` file from [releases](https://github.com/tact-lang/tact-language-server/releases)
2. In VS Code:
    - Open the Command Palette (`Ctrl+Shift+P` or `Cmd+Shift+P`)
    - Type "Install from VSIX"
    - Select the downloaded `.vsix` file
    - Reload VS Code

### Other Editors

Download the pre-built language server:

1. Get the latest archive from [releases](https://github.com/tact-lang/tact-language-server/releases):
    - `tact-language-server-*.tar.gz` for Linux/macOS
    - `tact-language-server-*.zip` for Windows
2. Extract it to a convenient location
3. Configure your editor to use the language server (see editor-specific instructions below)

### Building from Source

If you want to build the language server yourself:

```shell
git clone https://github.com/tact-lang/tact-language-server
cd tact-language-server
yarn install
yarn build
```

For VS Code extension, additionally run:

```shell
yarn package
```

## Editor Setup

### Helix

1. Make sure you have Helix installed and configured
2. Add the following configuration to your `~/.config/helix/languages.toml`:

    ```toml
    [[language]]
    name = "tact"
    language-servers = ["tact-language-server"]

    [language-server.tact-language-server]
    command = "node"
    args = ["path/to/language-server/dist/server.js", "--stdio"]
    ```

3. Replace `path/to/language-server` with the actual path where you cloned the repository
4. Restart Helix for changes to take effect

### Neovim

Prerequisites:

- [nvim-lspconfig](https://github.com/neovim/nvim-lspconfig)
- Neovim 0.5.0 or newer

Setup steps:

1. Add `tact.lua` to your `lua/lspconfig/server_configurations` directory with the following content:

    ```lua
    local util = require 'lspconfig.util'

    return {
      default_config = {
        cmd = { 'node', '/absolute/path/to/language-server/dist/server.js', '--stdio' },
        filetypes = { 'tact' },
        root_dir = util.root_pattern('package.json', '.git'),
      },
      docs = {
        description = [[
          Tact Language Server
          https://github.com/tact-lang/tact-language-server
        ]],
        default_config = {
          root_dir = [[root_pattern("package.json", ".git")]],
        },
      },
    }
    ```

2. Add the following to your `init.lua`:

    ```lua
    require'lspconfig'.tact.setup {}
    ```

### Sublime Text

1. Install [LSP](https://packagecontrol.io/packages/LSP) package:

    - Open Command Palette (`Ctrl+Shift+P` or `Cmd+Shift+P`)
    - Select "Package Control: Install Package"
    - Search for and select "LSP"

2. Install the `Tact` package via Package Control for syntax highlighting

3. Add the following configuration to your LSP settings (`Preferences > Package Settings > LSP > Settings`):

    ```json
    {
        "clients": {
            "tact": {
                "enabled": true,
                "command": ["node", "path/to/language-server/dist/server.js", "--stdio"],
                "selector": "source.tact"
            }
        }
    }
    ```

4. Create a new file with `.tact` extension to verify the setup

## Troubleshooting

Common issues:

- Path to the language server is incorrect
- Node.js is not installed
- Language server wasn't built properly

### Logs Location

The language server generates logs that can help diagnose issues:

- For standalone server: logs are written to `dist/tact-language-server.log` in the language server directory
- For VS Code extension: logs can be found in:
    - Windows: `%USERPROFILE%\.vscode\extensions\tact-[version]\dist\tact-language-server.log`
    - macOS/Linux: `~/.vscode/extensions/tact-[version]/dist/tact-language-server.log`
