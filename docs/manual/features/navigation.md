## Go to definition

The language server provides go to definition for all Tact definitions: you can go to the definition of a variable,
parameter, function, trait, etc.

[definition.mov](../assets/definition.mov)

In addition to this, LS also provides several additional locations that can be resolved:

### initOf

`initOf` resolves to the contract name or its `init()` function if it exists:

[initOf.mov](../assets/initOf.mov)

## Go to type definition

Go to definition of the current identifier type:

[type-definition.mov](../assets/type-definition.mov)
